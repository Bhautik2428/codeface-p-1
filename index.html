            <h1>Worid's Biggest Statue</h1>
            <p>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet), located near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel is highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India to form the single Union of India. The statue is located in Gujarat on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city of Vadodara.

                The project was first announced in 2010, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹27 billion (US$422 million). It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar and was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth.
                <br>
                Narendra Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013 to mark the beginning of his tenth year as the chief minister of Gujarat. A society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, to execute the project.Statue of Unity Movement was started in 2013 to collect the iron needed for the statue by asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments. By 2016, a total of 135 metric tonnes of scrap iron had been collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the foundation of the statue after processing.A marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15 December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support of the project.</p>

                <p>Vallabhbhai Patel (October 31, 1875 – December 15, 1950), the icon of India’s solidarity and integrity and the champion of peasant’s movement in British India, was a political and social leader of India who played a major role in the country’s struggle for Independence and subsequently guided its integration into a united, Independent nation. He is known as the ‘Iron Man of India’. After the great victory of Bardoli peasants’ movement, people named him ‘Sardar’. Vallabhbhai Patel already had a successful practice as a lawyer when he was first inspired by the work and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. Vallabhbhai Patel subsequently organised the peasants of Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in a non-violent Civil Disobedience Movement against oppressive policies imposed by the British Raj. In this role, he became the most influential leader in Gujarat under guidance of Mahatma Gandhi. He rose to the leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1931 at the Karachi Congress Session and was at the forefront of all political events from 1931 onwards, at national level. He was a key figure in organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 and promoting the Quit India Movement of 1942, which resulted into arrest of almost all the leaders of freedom struggle. <br> As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Sardar Patel organised relief for refugees in Punjab and Delhi as well as led efforts to restore peace across the nation. Sardar Patel took charge of the task to forge a united India from the 562 semi-autonomous princely states and British-era colonial provinces. Using frank diplomacy backed with the option (and the use) of military action, Sardar Patel’s leadership enabled the accession of almost every princely state. Hailed as the Iron Man of India, he is also remembered as the ‘Patron Saint’ of India’s civil servants for establishing modern all-India services. Sardar Patel was also one of the earliest proponents of property rights and free enterprise in India. His contribution as the Chairman of the Constitutional Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities’ rights, Provincial Constitutions, and Demarcation of Borders of Scheduled Areas are the pillars of the Indian Constitution.</p>
